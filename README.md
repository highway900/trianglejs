trianglejs
==========

A Realtime javascript framework for collaborative inter office 'Mills&Boons' style love stories.

This framework forgets about the boiler plate and real world applications and lets you get on with your assumptions about office relationships.

Example:

Better.Person = Triangle.Hipster.create({
	name: 'Ziggy',
	hasBeard: true,
});
